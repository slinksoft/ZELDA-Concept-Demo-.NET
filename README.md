# Zelda Concept Demo in .NET

<p align="center">
An old .NET project I made during my college days. Making open source to show my current colleagues my previous game development work.
<br><br>
Original 2015 description:<br>
This is a concept demo of The Legend of Zelda NES fully coded from scratch in C#. This project was one that put my game programming skills to the test. Has multiple rooms, enemies, item drops, boss, inventory system, shielding, and shop system. For a more in depth description, go view this project on Slink's Realm.
